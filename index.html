        My name is Aman Alduma I am from sudan, white Nill which loctaed it in the south sudan.I studied heistory, but now as the life changed I turned to study coding futue to be a developer I staretd learning coding in a few moths ago this has hepled me alot to to learn the basic of program. Also, I found my self very mouch intersted , so I decied to joine CYF community, so has help me quite alot .
        program language is the powers of our digital world. Every website, smartphone app, computer programme, calculator and AI on code in order to operate. This makes coders the architects and builders of the digital age.

      <p><b>
          Over the next 10 years it is estimated that there will be 1 million jobs in computer sciences. However, there are only around 250,000 graduates qualified to do them.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jobs not directly linked to computer sciences – such as banking, medicine and journalism – will also be affected by the need for at least an understanding of
        programming and coding.
      </p>

        “Our world is increasingly run by software and we need more diversity in the people who are building it. More importantly, writing software is about
        expression, creativity – and practical application,” Liukas told IBTimes UK.
      </p>

        “Our kids should learn to bend, join, break and combine code in a way it wasn’t designed to. It’s a whole generation of kids that will use code like our
        generation used words.”.
      </p>
      <p>I hope I can change the future by coding </p>
